# Agent settings

Note

Antigravity’s updated permission system is currently available on **macOS and Linux**. On **Windows**, Antigravity continues to use the previous settings. Refer to the [Windows](#windows) section for details.

## macOS and Linux

### Permission settings

This setting controls how agent actions—terminal commands, file access, MCP tools, and web page reads—are approved using a **permission preset**:

*   **Default**: Commands run without prompting inside the [Terminal sandbox](/docs/sandbox); running outside the sandbox requires approval. The agent can read and write the workspace and temp directories, and needs approval for anything else.
*   **Request Review**: The sandbox is off and every terminal command requires approval. The agent can read and write the workspace, and needs approval for anything else.
*   **Turbo**: All commands run without prompting with no isolation or restrictions, and the agent has full read and write access to your filesystem.

You can configure the preset under **Settings** > **General** > **Permission Settings**, and override it per project under **Settings** > **Projects**. Projects default to **Inherit General**, which follows your global preset.

Your configured allow, deny, and ask permission rules are layered on top of the preset and always take precedence. To learn more, refer to **[Agent permissions](/docs/permissions)**.

## Windows

### Terminal command auto execution

This setting controls how the agent executes generated shell commands:

*   **Request Review**: The agent never executes terminal commands without prompting (except those explicitly added to your configurable Allow list).
*   **Proceed in Sandbox**: Commands run without prompting inside the [Terminal sandbox](/docs/sandbox); commands that need to run outside it still require review.
*   **Always Proceed**: The agent executes commands without prompting (except those explicitly added to your configurable Deny list).

### Agent non-workspace file access

This setting allows the agent to view and edit files outside of the active project folders:

*   By default, the agent only has access to the folders inside your project and the application’s local app data directory `~/.gemini/antigravity/` (which contains artifacts, knowledge items, and more).
*   Enforcing this boundary protects your local sensitive data. Enable non-workspace access with caution.

### Terminal sandbox mode

This setting restricts agent terminal commands to an isolated sandbox:

*   When enabled, shell commands execute inside the sandbox without access to sensitive system paths or unauthorized networks.
*   You can configure this setting globally in application preferences or override it per project.
*   To learn more, refer to the **[Terminal sandbox](/docs/sandbox)** guide.
