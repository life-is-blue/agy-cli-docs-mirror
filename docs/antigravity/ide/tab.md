# Antigravity IDE: Tab and navigation

This guide covers the core navigation and completion tools: **Supercomplete**, **Tab-to-Jump**, and **Tab-to-Import**.

## Supercomplete

Supercomplete provides code suggestions in a region near your current cursor position.

### How it works

Supercomplete includes the following capabilities:

*   **File-wide suggestions**: Suggestions can modify code throughout the document, handling tasks like changing variable names or updating separate function definitions simultaneously.
*   **Accepting**: Press `Tab` to accept the changes.

## Tab-to-Jump

Tab-to-Jump is a fluid navigation tool that suggests the next logical place in your document to move your cursor to.

### How it works

Tab-to-Jump works in the following ways:

*   **Navigation**: A **Tab to jump** icon appears, offering to move your cursor to your next logical edit location. Press `Tab` to immediately move your cursor to that location.
*   **Accepting**: Press `Tab` to accept the jump.

## Tab-to-Import

Tab-to-Import handles missing dependencies without breaking your flow.

### How it works

Tab-to-Import works in the following ways:

*   **Detection**: If you type a class or function that isn’t imported, Antigravity suggests the import.
*   **Action**: Press `Tab` to complete the word and immediately add the import statement to the top of the file.

## Settings

In your settings, you can customize the behavior of these features:

*   **Enable or disable features**: You can individually turn off Autocomplete, Tab-to-Jump, Supercomplete, or Tab-to-Import.
*   **Tab speed**: Controls the responsiveness of suggestions:
    *   `Slow`: Waits for more context before suggesting.
    *   `Default`: Offers a balanced pace.
    *   `Fast`: Provides rapid-fire suggestions.
*   **Highlight inserted text**: When enabled, text inserted using Tab is highlighted so you can track changes easily.
*   **Clipboard context**: When enabled, Antigravity uses the contents of your clipboard to improve completion accuracy.
*   **Allow gitignored files**: Enables Tab features (suggestions and jumping) within files listed in your `.gitignore` file. Tab ignores gitignored files only if Git is installed.
