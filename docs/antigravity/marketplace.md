# Marketplace

The Marketplace lets you discover, install, and manage curated [plugins](/docs/plugins) that extend your agent with reusable [skills](/docs/skills), [MCP servers](/docs/mcp), [rules](/docs/rules), and [subagents](/docs/subagents).

## Inline `/plugin` commands

In addition to the interactive panel, `/plugin` supports inline commands to `install`, `uninstall`, `enable`, `disable`, and `list` plugins directly from the prompt without opening the Plugins Manager UI:

*   **Install from a marketplace or local directory**:
    
    ```
    /plugin install <plugin-name>@<marketplace-name>
    /plugin install <local-path>
    ```
    
    For example, running `/plugin install firebase@agent-marketplace` outputs:
    
    ```
    Successfully installed plugin "firebase" from "agent-marketplace"
    ```
    
*   **Manage and list plugins inline**:
    
    ```
    /plugin uninstall <plugin-name>
    /plugin enable <plugin-name>
    /plugin disable <plugin-name>
    /plugin list
    ```
