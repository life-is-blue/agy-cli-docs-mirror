# Remote Control

Antigravity Remote Control allows you to securely connect to and drive your Antigravity desktop sessions and CLI instances running across your machines from any web browser.

As AI agents take on larger-scope tasks—such as full-subsystem refactorings, extensive test suite runs, and complex dependency migrations—operations can run for extended periods. Remote Control untethers you from your physical desk while preserving your entire local development environment.

## Enabling Remote Control in Antigravity 2.0

You can enable Remote Control directly from the Antigravity 2.0 Settings:

1.  Open the **Settings** panel by pressing `Cmd + ,` (or `Ctrl + ,` on Linux/Windows), or click **Settings** at the bottom of the left sidebar.
2.  Navigate to the **App** section.
3.  Toggle **Enable Remote Control** to **On**.
4.  _(Optional)_ Set a custom **Nickname** (e.g., `workstation-primary` or `server-machine`) to easily identify this machine in your instance list.

### Connecting from a web browser

To access your remote Antigravity instance:

1.  Open your web browser on any device and navigate to the [Antigravity Remote Control Dashboard](https://antigravity.google.com). (Tip: On mobile devices, you can optionally install the web app to your home screen to receive push notifications when agents complete tasks or request input.)
2.  Sign in with the same Google Account that you used on your desktop application.
3.  In the instance switcher, select the machine you want to control.
4.  You now have full access to view active conversations, start new agent tasks, review implementation plans, and inspect artifacts.

## Desktop troubleshooting

### Antigravity 2.0 Desktop

*   **Machine Does Not Appear in the Web UI**:
    *   Ensure that **Enable Remote Control** is toggled on in Antigravity 2.0 Settings on your host machine.
    *   Verify that your host machine has an active internet connection and is not asleep or suspended.
    *   Check that you are signed in with the same Google Account in both the desktop app and the web browser.
*   **Reconnection and Disconnects**:
    *   If your local network connectivity drops temporarily, the web interface automatically tries to reconnect. Any running background agent tasks and shell commands will continue executing on your host machine uninterrupted as long as the host maintains an internet connection.

## Overview

Remote Control lets you interact with your CLI instances remotely using the Antigravity desktop UI. Antigravity CLI supports two ways to use Remote Control:

1.  **Interactive Mode**: Start a Remote Control connection in an active CLI instance using `/remote-control` or start it in a new instance by launching the CLI with the `--remote-control` flag. Tunnel stays open only for the lifetime of that CLI instance.
2.  **Headless Background Daemon**: Start a connection to an always-on headless CLI instance with `agy remote-control start`. You will be able to interact with this instance remotely as long as the machine running it is on.

* * *

## Interactive Mode

### Enable Remote Control in an active session (`/remote-control`)

You can turn on Remote Control at any point during an interactive `agy` terminal session without restarting the CLI.

Inside the prompt box, run `/remote-control` (or `/remote-control on`):

```
/remote-control
```

The CLI establishes a reverse tunnel for the current session and prints the session’s hostname along with a link to open the active conversation on another device:

```
Remote control on for this session.
Hostname: devbox-swift-falcon
Open https://antigravity.google.com/r/<instance-id>?p=c%2F<conversation-id> on another device to continue this conversation.
```

Open the printed URL in any web browser (on your laptop, tablet, or phone) signed into the same Google Account to interact with the session using the Antigravity desktop UI.

To disconnect the remote tunnel while keeping your local terminal session running, run:

```
/remote-control off
```

```
Remote control off. This machine is no longer reachable from other devices.
Hostname: devbox-swift-falcon
```

### Launch directly with Remote Control (`--remote-control`)

To start a remote connection immediately upon launching an interactive CLI session, use the `--remote-control` flag:

```
agy --remote-control
```

### How interactive Remote Control works

#### Session lifecycle

Interactive Remote Control is strictly tied to the running `agy` terminal process:

*   **Automatic cleanup on exit**: When you exit the interactive CLI (`/exit`, `Ctrl+C`, or `Ctrl+D`) or close the terminal window, the Remote Control tunnel automatically terminates and the instance disappears from the dashboard.
*   **Concurrent terminal sessions**: Because each interactive CLI process generates its own session instance ID and session hostname, you can run `agy --remote-control` across multiple terminal tabs or project directories simultaneously.

#### Live bidirectional synchronization

When you connect to your interactive CLI session using the Antigravity desktop UI in your browser, both surfaces stay synchronized in real time:

*   **Shared live stream**: Prompts submitted from your remote device stream live into your local terminal TUI as they happen, and thoughts, tool executions, and diffs generated in the terminal appear live in the remote UI.
*   **Cross-device tool approvals & questions**: When the agent pauses for a tool confirmation (`y`/`n`) or asks an interactive clarifying question, you can respond from either your local terminal or the remote UI.
*   **CLI-controlled settings**: You cannot toggle settings in the settings panel from the remote web interface; to change settings, use the CLI.

* * *

## Remote Control Headless Daemon

Use the `remote-control` subcommand to register an always-on headless CLI instance that starts automatically in the background and stays connected whenever your machine is powered on:

```
agy remote-control start
```

The daemon registers as an OS service (a systemd user service on Linux, a LaunchAgent on macOS, or a Scheduled Task on Windows) and starts immediately without requiring an open terminal window.

Run `agy remote-control status` to see this machine’s instance name, then select it from the [Antigravity Remote Control Dashboard](https://antigravity.google.com) to interact with it using the Antigravity desktop UI.

### Managing the daemon

```
agy remote-control start     Register and start the daemon
agy remote-control status    Show the daemon's status and instance name
agy remote-control stop      Stop the daemon and unregister it
```

### Windows notes

*   Registering the daemon to **start at boot** requires an Administrator prompt. PowerShell and Command Prompt both work.
*   From a normal prompt, `start` still works, but if your machine gets logged out/restarted, the daemon will only resume after you log back in: it cannot start on boot.
*   `status` and `stop` work from a normal prompt.

### Sign-in

The credentials you used to sign into the CLI are used by the daemon for auth. This sign-in is separate from the Antigravity editor’s on the same machine.

### Naming your machine (headless daemon)

For headless daemon instances, the instance name is how the machine appears in Remote Control:

*   Set it with the `--name` flag:
    
    ```
    agy remote-control start --name "my-workstation"
    ```
    
    Re-running `start --name` with a new value renames the machine.
    
*   If you never set a name, the daemon generates a friendly one (like `my-machine-distant-plume`) on its first start. `agy remote-control status` shows the current name.
    
*   To rename by editing the settings file instead, open `~/.gemini/config/config.json` on Linux/macOS or `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\config\config.json` on Windows, change the value of `cliRemoteControlHostname`, save, and run `agy remote-control start` again to restart the daemon. The new name appears in the Antigravity Remote Control dashboard once the service restarts — edits do nothing while it’s running.
    

Note

**Important:** The file has two similar-looking names in it. `cliRemoteControlHostname` is this service — the one you want. `remoteControlHostname` is the Antigravity editor on the same machine; in Antigravity 2.0, you can edit this directly in **Settings > App**.

### How the daemon runs

| Behavior | Linux | macOS | Windows |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Starts | At boot, nobody needs to log in | When you log in | At boot (Administrator install); at login otherwise |
| Keeps running after you sign out | Yes | No, back at next login. | Yes, with a boot install |
| Comes back by itself after a crash | Yes | Yes | Yes, up to 3 restart attempts, then at the next boot or by running `agy remote-control start` again |

## Interactive Mode vs. Headless Background Daemon

Use the table below to choose between interactive Remote Control and the persistent background daemon.

| Feature | Interactive Mode (`/remote-control` / `agy --remote-control`) | Headless Background Daemon (`agy remote-control start`) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Scope** | Single interactive terminal session | Entire machine (background OS service) |
| **Lifecycle** | Active only while the terminal session is open and toggled on | Persistent across logouts and system reboots |
| **Instance naming** | Fresh per-session name (e.g., `host-swift-falcon`) | Single persistent machine name (`--name` or `cliRemoteControlHostname`) |
| **Concurrency** | Multiple concurrent terminal sessions supported per machine | One daemon service per machine |
| **Direct handoff link** | Prints a link directly into the active conversation thread | Accessed via the instance switcher on `antigravity.google.com` |
| **Best for** | Stepping away from an active terminal task and continuing on mobile/web | Always-on remote access to a workstation or server anytime |

## CLI troubleshooting

### Interactive mode issues

*   **`Remote control is not enabled for your account.`** — account or organization policy has not enabled the Remote Control feature flag. Contact your workspace administrator or verify your account plan supports Remote Control.
*   **Instance disappears from the web dashboard** — `/remote-control` and `agy --remote-control` create tunnels that automatically disconnect when the interactive terminal session exits (`/exit` or `Ctrl+C`), or when `/remote-control off` is run. To keep a machine reachable when no terminal is open, run `agy remote-control start` to install the headless daemon.
*   **Multiple CLI instances listed for the same machine** — each interactive CLI session uses a distinct session hostname so you can control multiple terminal windows simultaneously.

### Headless daemon issues

*   **Machine doesn’t show up in the Antigravity Remote Control dashboard** — run `agy remote-control status`. If it reports sign-in problems, run `agy`, sign in, then run `agy remote-control start` again.
*   **Checking the logs**:
    *   Linux: `journalctl --user -u antigravity-cli-daemon -n 50`
    *   macOS: `~/Library/Logs/antigravity-cli-daemon.log`
    *   Windows: the newest `cli-*.log` under `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\antigravity-cli\log`
*   **Rename didn’t take effect** — the name is read when the daemon starts; run `agy remote-control start` again.
*   **Windows: daemon only starts at login, not at boot** — `start` was run from a non-Administrator prompt. Re-run `agy remote-control start` from an elevated prompt for start-at-boot.
*   **Connection keeps dropping and reconnecting** — an old script-installed daemon may still be registered and fighting this one for the connection. Run `agy remote-control start` again; it removes the old service automatically.
*   **Two similar entries in the Antigravity Remote Control dashboard** — one is the editor, one is this daemon. They’re separate on purpose; rename whichever one you mean.
