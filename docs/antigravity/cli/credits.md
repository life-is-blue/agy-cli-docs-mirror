# Managing AI credits and quotas

The Antigravity CLI integrates with your subscription to monitor and manage your AI Premium credits and usage quotas.

For a detailed explanation of baseline quotas, how credits are consumed, and plan eligibility, refer to the main **[Plans](/docs/plans)** page.

## Quota tracking

You can monitor your active quota and credit consumption directly inside the CLI:

*   **Statusline indicator**: The right side of the CLI statusline displays your remaining credit count (for example, `AI Credits: 42`).
*   **Low quota alert**: When your remaining AI credits drop below the warning threshold, the statusline indicator highlights to warn you that your limits are near.

## Slash commands and managing balance

You can query your credits or buy additional quota directly from the CLI:

*   **Query balance**: Run the **[AI credits command](/docs/cli/commands/credits)** to open the dedicated credits panel. This panel displays your detailed credit usage statistics.
*   **Managing credits**: You can purchase AI credits or upgrade your subscription, which opens a panel containing direct pricing and subscription portal links.

## Settings configuration

To control when and how your AI credits are used, you can toggle credit settings in your `settings.json` file:

```
{
    "useG1Credits": true
}
```

You can also configure this option interactively in the CLI:

*   **Use AI credits option**: Run `/config` or `/settings` to open the CLI settings panel. Set the **Use G1 Credits** field to **on** to allow the CLI to use your personal credits when plan quotas are exhausted, or set it to **off** to restrict fallback billing. To learn more, refer to the **[Plans](/docs/plans#overages)** overages section.
