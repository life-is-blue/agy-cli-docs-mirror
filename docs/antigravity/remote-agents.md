# Remote Agents

Available on: Antigravity App, Antigravity CLI

Antigravity Remote Agents run your agent sessions and tools in an isolated, Google-managed remote environment rather than on your local machine.

Because execution happens remotely, Remote Agents continue working on long-running tasks and executing commands even when you close your browser, put your laptop to sleep, or switch between desktop and mobile devices.

Availability

Remote Agents is available to **Google AI Pro** and **Google AI Ultra** subscribers who sign in with a personal Google Account, and is rolling out gradually. It isn’t available on the free plan, on Google AI Plus, or for business accounts (Google Workspace or Google Cloud).

## Remote Agents vs. Remote Control

Antigravity provides two ways to work with agents remotely depending on where your code and tools live. Use the following table to compare **Remote Agents** and **[Remote Control](/docs/remote-control)**:

| Feature | Remote Agents | [Remote Control](/docs/remote-control) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Execution environment** | Isolated, Google-managed remote environment | Your own desktop workstation or server |
| **Host machine requirement** | Runs independently; no local machine needs to stay on | Requires your host machine to remain powered on and online |
| **Workspace and files** | Remote **Resources** (GitHub repositories, Google Drive files, and uploaded files) | Local filesystem folders, local toolchains, and Git worktrees |
| **Best for** | Repository tasks, mobile workflows, and background execution while away | Tasks that require local hardware, local dev servers, or uncommitted local checkouts |

## Getting started

You can launch and manage Remote Agents from the **Antigravity App** on your desktop, from the **Antigravity CLI** in your terminal, or directly from any web browser at [antigravity.google.com](https://antigravity.google.com).

### Antigravity App

#### Start in the Antigravity App

To create a remote project alongside your local projects in the Antigravity App, do the following:

1.  In the left sidebar, click **+** next to **Projects** (or open the project selector in the message box) and select **New Remote Project**.
2.  _(Optional)_ Click **Add Resource** to attach GitHub repositories, Google Drive files, or uploaded files from your computer, and then click **Next** (or **Skip** if you do not add any resources yet).
3.  Enter a name in **Set Project Name** and click **Create**.
4.  Select your remote project and send a prompt in the message box to start a remote conversation.

You can also start a remote project directly from a GitHub repository in the message box:

1.  In the message box, click the project selector dropdown.
2.  Select **Remote** > **GitHub Repositories**. If you have not connected your GitHub account yet, click **Connect GitHub** to authorize access.
3.  Choose a repository from the list. Antigravity automatically selects an existing remote project for that repository or creates a new one.

#### Start on the web

To use Remote Agents from a desktop or mobile browser without installing a local application, do the following:

1.  Open your browser and navigate to [antigravity.google.com](https://antigravity.google.com).
2.  Sign in with a personal Google Account on an eligible plan (Google AI Pro or Google AI Ultra).
3.  Enter a prompt in the message box to start a standalone remote conversation, or click **Create Project** next to **Projects** in the left sidebar to configure a project with GitHub repositories, Google Drive files, or uploaded files.

#### Switch between Remote Agents and Remote Control

If you also use [Remote Control](/docs/remote-control) to connect to local Antigravity App or Antigravity CLI instances, use the instance switcher on [antigravity.google.com](https://antigravity.google.com) (in the left sidebar above **Settings** on desktop browsers, or in the top bar on mobile) to switch between **Remote Conversations** and any of your connected host machines.

### Antigravity CLI

#### Start a remote agent session

To run your Antigravity CLI conversations on Remote Agents, do the following:

1.  Make sure that you’re running Antigravity CLI 1.4.12 or later. To update the CLI, run `agy update`.
    
2.  Sign in to the CLI with a personal Google Account on an eligible plan (see **Availability**). The CLI shows the signed-in account and its plan when it starts, and in `/help`.
    
3.  Start the CLI with the `--remote-agent` flag:
    
    ```bash
    agy --remote-agent
    ```
    
4.  Enter a prompt to start a remote conversation.
    

Every conversation that you start in the session runs on a remote agent, and the status line shows `remote` and the name of the remote project. Because the agent runs remotely, it keeps working on a task even if your machine goes to sleep or loses its connection, and you can continue the conversation later from the CLI, the Antigravity App, or the web.

Note

A remote agent works in its own remote environment, not in the directory where you start the CLI, so it can’t read or change files on your machine. To give it code and files to work with, attach them to its remote project as described in [Attach repositories and files](#attach-repositories-and-files).

#### Choose a remote project

The first time that you start a remote agent session on a machine, the CLI creates a remote project named `CLI Project (<hostname>)` for that machine and opens new conversations in it. Later remote agent sessions on the same machine and account reuse that project.

To open conversations in a different remote project, such as one that you created in the Antigravity App or on the web, pass the project’s name or ID with `--project`:

```bash
agy --remote-agent --project="My remote project"
```

If no remote project has that name or ID, the CLI shows a warning and uses the machine’s default remote project instead.

To create a new remote project named after the current directory, pass `--new-project`:

```bash
agy --remote-agent --new-project
```

To switch projects during a session, run `/projects`, select a project, press Enter, choose **Switch to project**, and confirm. The CLI starts a new conversation in that project.

#### Attach repositories and files

Remote agents work with the resources attached to their remote project. To create a remote project with resources from the CLI, do the following:

1.  Run `/projects` and select **\+ New project…** at the top of the list.
2.  Enter a name for the project, and then press the right arrow key to choose its resources.
3.  Attach any of the following resources:
    *   **GitHub**: Select GitHub and press Enter. If you haven’t connected GitHub yet, sign in to it in your browser. Then select the repositories to attach.
    *   **Google Drive**: Select Google Drive and press Enter, signing in if you haven’t connected it yet. Then select **\+ Add a Drive file by link…** and paste a link to a Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Drive file.
    *   **Uploaded files**: Select **Upload Files**, then **\+ Add a local file…**, and enter the path of a file on your machine.
4.  Press Ctrl + S to create the project.

To change the resources of an existing remote project, run `/projects`, select the project, press Enter, and choose **Edit**. These are the same resources that you can manage in the Antigravity App and on the web. For details, see [Remote projects and resources](#remote-projects-and-resources).

#### Resume remote conversations

Remote agent conversations are stored with your remote projects rather than on your machine. To continue your most recent remote agent conversation, run the following command:

```bash
agy --remote-agent -c
```

To resume a specific remote agent conversation, pass its ID:

```bash
agy --remote-agent --conversation=<conversation_id>
```

When you exit a remote agent session, the CLI prints the command that resumes your conversation. During a session, run `/resume` to choose from your remote agent conversations.

Note

A session started with `--remote-agent` opens only remote agent conversations, and a session started without it opens only local conversations. To resume a local conversation, start the CLI without `--remote-agent`.

#### Remote agent settings

Remote agent sessions use your [CLI settings](/docs/settings?tab=cli) from `settings.json`, such as your color scheme, verbosity, and editor mode, except for permissions. For permissions, remote agents follow your remote agent settings, which apply to all of your remote agent sessions.

In a remote agent session, `/config` splits your settings into two tabs. Press Tab to switch between them:

*   **TUI**: Your CLI settings. This tab hides the settings that your remote agent settings replace: **Agent Mode**, **Tool Permission**, **Artifact Review**, **Sandbox Mode**, and **Non-Workspace Access**.
*   **Remote Agent**: Your remote agent settings:
    *   **Permission Preset**: Controls which actions the agent can take. `default` asks before sensitive operations, `request review` asks before every command, and `always-proceed (turbo)` runs all commands without restrictions.
    *   **Plan Review Policy**: Controls whether the agent asks you to review its documents, such as implementation plans: `always ask` or `always proceed`.

To manage the allow, deny, and ask rules that remote agents follow, run `/permissions`. In a remote agent session, it shows your remote agent rules instead of your local rules.

Unless you change it, the permission preset is `always-proceed (turbo)`, so remote agents run commands without asking for approval. Remote agent sessions always use the default [execution mode](/docs/cli/modes), so plan, accept-edits, and auto mode aren’t available.

#### Features not available in remote agent sessions

The following CLI features aren’t available in remote agent sessions yet:

*   Print mode (`--print`)
*   Code search (`/codesearch`)
*   `/diff`, `/fork`, `/rewind`, and `/btw`
*   Voice dictation (`/voice`)
*   Running terminal commands yourself with `!`
*   Sending messages to subagents with `@`
*   MCP servers, plugins, and agent skills installed on your machine

If you run a slash command that isn’t available, the CLI reports that it’s not available in remote agent sessions.

#### CLI troubleshooting

Review the following solutions for common issues with remote agent sessions:

*   **Remote conversations don’t start**: Make sure that you’re signed in to the CLI with a personal Google Account on an eligible plan (see **Availability**). Run `/help` to see the signed-in account.
*   **`Project Not Found` warning**: No remote project has the name or ID that you passed with `--project`, so the CLI uses this machine’s default remote project instead. Run `/projects` to see the names of your remote projects.
*   **`is a local conversation` warning**: The ID that you passed with `--conversation` belongs to a local conversation. Start the CLI without `--remote-agent` to resume it.
*   **`@` suggests sending a message first**: A remote agent’s environment starts with the conversation. After you send the first message, `@` suggests files from the remote agent’s environment.
*   **`Not available in remote agent sessions.`**: The command isn’t supported in remote agent sessions yet. For the full list, see [Features not available in remote agent sessions](#features-not-available-in-remote-agent-sessions).

## Remote projects and resources

While local [projects](/docs/projects) mount directories from your workstation under **Folders**, remote projects attach external context under **Resources**. You can attach or remove resources when creating a remote project, or at any time under **Project Settings** > **Resources** by clicking **Add Resource**:

*   **GitHub**: Authorize GitHub with OAuth and select one or more repositories to attach to the project. Conversations automatically clone and mount your connected repositories into the remote workspace for development. All private repositories within the same project must belong to the same GitHub user or organization owner; to work with private repositories from multiple owners, create a separate remote project for each owner.
*   **Google Drive**: Select files or folders from your Google Drive (using the Google Drive Picker on the web interface or the Drive file list in the Antigravity App), such as Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, PDFs, or folders. The remote agent reads attached Drive files on demand during conversations.
*   **Uploaded files**: Upload local files from your device (up to 8 MiB per file, 50 files and 100 MiB per project, and 2 GiB total across your account), including source code, text and data files, images, PDFs, and `.zip` archives. Uploaded files persist across conversations in the project and are staged under `/home/antigravity/upload`.

In the Antigravity CLI, run `/projects` to attach and remove resources. For details, see [Attach repositories and files](#attach-repositories-and-files).

## Plugins and credentials

Remote Agents support [plugins](/docs/plugins) that connect your agent to external tools and services:

1.  Open **Customizations** in the left sidebar and select the **Marketplace** tab (under **Apps**, or **Installed** once connected).
2.  Browse available plugins, such as **GitHub**, **Google Drive**, **Google Docs**, **Google Sheets**, **Google Slides**, and **Google Calendar**.
3.  Click **Connect** next to a plugin to authorize your account with OAuth.

In a remote agent session in the Antigravity CLI, run `/plugin` to connect plugins from the **Discover** tab and manage them in the **Installed** tab.

Your OAuth credentials are encrypted at rest and tokens are securely injected when the remote agent makes requests to authorized services.
