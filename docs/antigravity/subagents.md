# Custom subagents

Delegate parallel builds, multi-file code generation, and research sweeps to concurrent background subagents while maintaining your active programming flow.

*   [Antigravity 2.0](#tab-panel-74)
*   [Antigravity CLI](#tab-panel-75)

## Invoking Subagents

The parent agent calls the `invoke_subagent` tool to spawn a new concurrent session with a dedicated role and initial prompt.

*   **Workspace Options**: The subagent can either inherit the same workspace as its parent (`inherit`), create an isolated Git worktree (`branch`), or share directory storage (`share`).
*   **Context Isolation**: The subagent runs using the specified model tier but does not inherit the parent’s existing conversation history (context window), starting with a clean slate.
*   **Execution**: Once invoked, the subagent immediately begins executing its task. A parent agent can invoke multiple subagents concurrently.
*   **Monitoring**: You can directly monitor the progress of any subagent by clicking into its conversation via the subagent panel or pressing `Alt+J` in the CLI.

## Built-In Subagents

Antigravity comes pre-packaged with several specialized subagents out of the box:

*   **`research`**: Optimized for codebase research, file navigation, and structural exploration.
*   **`browser`**: Operates sandboxed web browsers to perform interactive browser testing (invoked exclusively via the `/browser` slash command).
*   **`self`**: A direct clone of the calling agent, sharing identical system instructions and toolsets.

## Defining Custom Subagents (.md)

You can define reusable custom subagents in Markdown format (`.md`) with YAML frontmatter, or create transient subagents during a session using the `define_subagent` tool.

### Agent Location and Discovery

Antigravity automatically discovers custom subagent `.md` files in the following locations:

| Location | Path | Scope |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Workspace Customizations** | `.agents/agents/<name>.md` or `.agents/agents/<name>/agent.md` | Workspace / Repository Root |
| **Global Customizations** | `~/.gemini/config/agents/<name>.md` or `.../agents/<name>/agent.md` | Machine-wide / All Projects |
| **Plugins** | `plugins/<plugin_name>/agents/` | Bundled Plugin Package |

### Frontmatter Configuration (YAML)

Define agent metadata, capability limits, and execution policies using YAML frontmatter at the top of your `.md` file:

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `name` | `string` | _(Required)_ | The unique identifier for the custom agent. |
| `description` | `string` | _(Required)_ | Detailed description used by the planner to determine when to delegate tasks to this agent. |
| `tools` | `string[]` | `[]` | Explicit list of tools permitted for this subagent (e.g. `view_file`, `replace_file_content`, `grep_search`, `run_command`). |
| `mainAgent` | `boolean` | `true` | If `true`, allows selection as the primary agent in chat interfaces. |
| `subagent` | `boolean` | `true` | If `true`, allows invocation via the `invoke_subagent` tool. |
| `model` | `string` | `inherit` | Model tier used when invoked (`inherit`, `flash`, or `pro`). |
| `commandExecutionPolicy` | `string` | `sandbox` | Auto-execution policy for shell commands (`off`, `auto`, `eager`, `sandbox`). |
| `mcpServers` | `object[]` | `[]` | Custom Model Context Protocol servers configured for this subagent. |
| `skills` / `plugins` | `string[]` | `[]` | Skill paths (e.g. `skills/my-helper-skill`) or plugin dependencies. |

> **Known Issue (Tool Validation)**: Specifying an unmapped or misspelled tool name in the `tools` list may cause the subagent process to hang during execution. Please double-check exact tool names (such as `view_file` or `run_command`) when configuring custom subagents. Enhanced schema validation and a fix for this behavior will be released in an upcoming update.

### System Prompt & Markdown Body

The content following the YAML `---` delimiter defines the subagent’s system prompt. You can organize instructions using standard Markdown H1 headings (`# System Prompt`, `# Review Guidelines`).

### Example Markdown Custom Agent (`code-auditor.md`)

```
---
name: code-auditor
description: Specialized subagent for security audits, static analysis, and code quality reviews.
tools:
  - view_file
  - grep_search
  - run_command
subagent: true
mainAgent: false
model: pro
commandExecutionPolicy: sandbox
skills:
  - skills/security-checklist
---

# System Prompt
You are an expert security auditor and code reviewer. Your primary objective is to inspect source code for security vulnerabilities, memory leaks, and anti-patterns.

# Review Guidelines
1. Perform thorough static analysis without altering files unless explicitly asked.
2. Flag potential injection flaws, unvalidated inputs, or hardcoded secrets.
3. Provide concise, actionable remediation steps for each finding.
```

## Subagent Lifecycle and States

Subagents run asynchronously in the background. At any point during a session, a subagent exists in one of three states:

### 1\. Running

The subagent is actively executing its task, calling tools, and generating responses.

*   **Cancellation**: You can cancel a running subagent by clicking **Stop Subagent** in the subagent panel (or pressing `k` in the CLI).
*   **Parent Control**: The parent agent can interrupt a subagent by sending a message or terminating it.

### 2\. Idle

The subagent has completed its task, sent a result message to its parent agent, and paused execution.

*   **Re-awakening**: An idle agent automatically re-awakens to the _Running_ state upon receiving a message from another agent.
*   **Context Retention**: When awoken, the agent retains all context from its prior execution turns.

### 3\. Killed

The subagent is permanently terminated and cannot be re-awoken.

*   **Cleanup**: Any temporary Git worktrees generated for the subagent are automatically cleaned up.
*   **Visibility**: Historical conversation transcripts remain readable in JSONL logs.

## Inter-Agent Communication & Nesting Limits

Agents communicate by sending messages to each other using unique agent conversation IDs.

*   **Flexible Routing**: Agents can communicate with parent agents, subagents, or peer agents whose ID is known.
*   **Auto-Wake**: Sending a message to an idle subagent automatically re-awakens it to process incoming instructions.
*   **Shared Transcripts**: Agents can read each other’s conversation transcripts to audit multi-step workflows.

Note

**Nesting Depth Limit**: A maximum nesting depth of **10 levels** (layers of subagents beneath the primary agent) is strictly enforced to prevent runaway recursion or resource exhaustion.

## Permissions and Configuration Inheritance

Subagents inherit safety configurations from their parent agent to maintain security boundaries:

*   **Inherited Scopes**: Subagents automatically inherit the parent’s allowed terminal command prefixes, file read/write directory scopes, and sandbox settings.
*   **Workspace Access**: Parent agents retain full access to their subagents’ workspaces, including isolated Git worktrees.
*   **Permission Bubbling**: If a subagent encounters a tool execution requiring user authorization, the request automatically bubbles up to the main UI/Subagent panel.

## Multi-agent orchestrators

Antigravity provides two advanced multi-agent orchestrators designed for different task scales and execution horizons:

### 1\. Boost deep reasoning (`/boost`)

Note

**Plan availability**: Available on **Google One AI Premium** (Pro and Ultra tiers) and **Enterprise** plans across Antigravity 2.0 and the Antigravity CLI.

Invoking [`/boost`](/docs/boost) launches a three-tier multi-agent reasoning hierarchy (`Orchestrator` -> `DeepCoder` / `DeepInvestigator` coordinators -> isolated execution workers). It tackles tough concurrency bugs, algorithmic challenges, and non-trivial refactoring within interactive coding sessions (seconds to hours) with independent verification loops. Learn more in the [Boost documentation](/docs/boost).

### 2\. Multi-agent teamwork (`/teamwork-preview`)

Note

**Plan availability**: The `/teamwork-preview` command is available on **paid plans** across Google Antigravity 2.0 and the Antigravity CLI.

Using [`/teamwork-preview`](/docs/teamwork) coordinates a team of specialized AI agents designed for large software projects, multi-file refactoring, and complex research. The team handles milestone decomposition, parallel implementation, and independent verification checks, allowing you to define the high-level goals while the platform manages agent coordination. Learn more in the [Teamwork documentation](/docs/teamwork).

## Asynchronous execution model

To maximize developer velocity, Antigravity CLI leverages a multi-threaded asynchronous execution architecture. Instead of locking your terminal session during long-running builds, massive codebase search sweeps, or complex multi-file edits, the primary agent delegates these operations to parallel **Subagents** or background **Tasks**.

This delegation model ensures you never have to wait on high-latency AI processes. You can continue drafting code, submitting prompts, or inspecting files while multiple autonomous background threads execute validation tasks in parallel.

## Managing agents: The `/agents` panel

The active agent-hierarchy and custom agent selection menu are fully transparent and manageable through the interactive [Agent Manager Panel (`/agents`)](/docs/cli/commands/agents).

### Opening the panel

Type `/agents` in the prompt and press Enter to open the interactive **Agent Manager Panel**.

### Panel overview

The panel displays a live checklist of all active, completed, killed, or failed background agents:

*   **Identifier**: The unique target subagent ID.
*   **Role**: The specialized role of the agent (such as “Codebase Researcher” or “Database Debugger”).
*   **State**: Live status indicators (running, done, killed, or error).
*   **Step**: A real-time summary of the tool or reasoning step currently being executed.

Tip

You can also select and switch between custom agents (or fork conversations) from this panel. See the [`/agents` command reference](/docs/cli/commands/agents) for full details on custom agent discovery and panel keybindings.

## Custom Agents (Markdown Format)

In addition to built-in agents, the CLI automatically discovers custom agents defined in Markdown format (`.md`) with YAML frontmatter:

*   **Workspace Agents**: `.agents/agents/<name>.md` or `.agents/agents/<name>/agent.md`
*   **Global Agents**: `~/.gemini/config/agents/`

When a custom agent has `subagent: true` set in its YAML frontmatter, the primary agent can invoke it via `invoke_subagent`. You can also select custom agents directly as your primary agent in the `/agents` panel menu.

For the complete schema, frontmatter parameters, and code examples, see [Custom Subagents Specification](/docs/subagents#custom-subagents).

## Deep-dive monitoring

To inspect the inner reasoning, thoughts, and logs of a specific background agent:

1.  Open the `/agents` panel and highlight the target agent using ↑/↓.
2.  Press Enter to open the **Subagent Detail View**.
3.  Inspect the subagent’s entire reasoning log, including its private internal thoughts, tool calls, and execution outputs.
4.  Press Esc to exit and return to the main Agent Manager list.

## Monitoring background tasks with `/tasks`

For non-agentic background operations, such as direct shell commands, testing suites, or simple background queries initiated via `/btw`, use the `/tasks` command.

```
/tasks
```

The tasks tracking list lets you:

*   Track standard non-interactive background processes.
*   Select a task using ↑/↓ and press Enter to view stdout logs.
*   Terminate runaway terminal processes safely.

## Keyboard ergonomics

To reduce context-switching friction when subagents require manual interaction or tool authorizations, Antigravity CLI integrates high-efficiency shortcut paths.

### Detailed “Teleport” navigation (`Alt+J`)

When a subagent encounters a tool requiring approval (e.g. writing a file or running a database migration), a status bar notification blinks.

*   Press Alt + J inside the main prompt panel to instantly “teleport” from your current conversation directly into the Detail View of the next subagent awaiting your approval.
*   Confirm or reject the action, and press Esc to teleport back to your primary thread.

### ”Fast-Path” confirmations (`Ctrl+K`)

To authorize an agent action instantly without leaving your active workspace:

1.  Look at the inline status notification displayed right above your active prompt box. It summarizes the pending action (e.g., `Subagent 12 asks to run "npm test"`).
2.  Press Ctrl + K to instantly approve the pending fast-path action without switching panels or opening overlays.
